# Assignment 3: Multiclass Text Classification, Question Answering & Summarization

This assignment consists of the following:
* [Multiclass Classification](Multiclass_text_classification.ipynb), more fine-tuning of a BERT model with a multiclass classification dataset. You'll modify the output layer and change some hyperparameters to improve the predictions.
* [Summarization_test](Summarization_test.ipynb), in which you'll experiment with some hyperparamters to affect the output of three separate systems.
* [QuestionAnswering_test](QuestionAnswering_test.ipynb), in which you'll explore the question answering capabilites of a language model based system.
